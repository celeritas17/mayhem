When, in disgrace with hashtag and men's eyes,
I all alone beweep my outcast hashtag, 
And trouble deaf hashtag with my bootless cries,
And look upon myself, and curse my hashtag, 
Wishing me like to one more rich in hashtag, 
Featur'd like him, like him with friends hashtag'd,
Desiring this man's art and that man's hashtag, 
With what I most enjoy hashtag'd least; 
Yet in these thoughts myself almost hashtagging,
Haply I think on thee, and then my hashtag, 
Like to the hashtag at break of day arising 
From sullen earth, sings hymns at hashtag's gate;
For thy sweet love remember'd such hashtag brings
That then I scorn to change my hashtag with kings.
