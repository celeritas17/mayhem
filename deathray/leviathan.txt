Leviathan, Inc.


Wouldst thou work for Leviathan?
Wouldst thou sit among the minds
that pierce the blind eye of ignorance
with the needle of truth?

Canst thou deny Leviathan’s reach?
His scale is his pride, he hugs the
globe airtight– no thought or word
can slip his warm embrace.

Wilt thou think with Leviathan?
He esteemeth only those minds
of the firmest intelligence:
Art thou a master of hard thought?

Wilt thou play with Leviathan?
And take your place among 
the luminous youth that live 
forever in the light of truth?

Wilt thou accept his bounty?
To be a servant to truth is to
bathe in gold. He owns all you
behold between sky and earth.

Wouldst thou work for Leviathan?
He will make a covenant with thee:
Give him your life and your work and 
you will feel the light of the future.
