The Flamingo Sky



The flamingo fell from a sky full of pink. 

That’s odd because the sky is always blue-eyed

or a monster sky of green garbage.

But the flamingo flooded it with pink.



The people saw a pink sky and a careless waste.

Pink was only fear to them because 

there’s safety in blue eyes or green garbage,

and a lack of safety is waste.



Some people had blue eyes

and thus could be forgiven

for fearing a pink sky, becuase

there’s safety in matching sky and eyes.



The flamingo fell again the next day

and the sky turned more pink than before.

This sky shocked the people more than before,

because pink is not a color they see every day.



So it happened twice and twice is a pattern,

and you don’t need blue eyes

to know a pattern when you see it,

and the safest thing is a pattern.



Now the people love flamingo pink.

Now the people say a prayer 

when they see the sky

glowing safe and pink.
