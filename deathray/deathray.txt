deathray

deathray, deathray
bright red beam;
flow of death,
in a constant stream

slice the dark, 
with your light-speed;
hit your mark, 
make the stars bleed

onward, onward
deathray, deathray fly;
flyaway free,
make the stars cry

Darkness dies in your
bright red beam;
light up land and sky,
kill everything between

flyaway free,
dreadful deathray beam;
oh deathray, deathray,
burn everything you see

dreadful deathray beam;
light my way, 
start to end,
kill everything between
