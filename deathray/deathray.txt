deathray

deathray, deathray
bright red beam;
deadly light
in a constant stream

slice the dark, 
with your light-speed;
hit your mark, 
make the stars bleed

onward, onward
deathray fly;
flyaway free,
make the stars cry

Darkness dies in your
bright red beam;
light up the sky,
burn everything 

flyaway free,
deathray beam;
deathray, deathray,
burn so clean

dreadful, dreadful 
deathray beam;
light my way,
burn everything
